Modern society runs on the internet, and the internet runs on databases.
Databases hold massive amounts of data on everything from your pwn.college scores (yes, we have a database!) to all of Wikipedia to less important things such as your credit score.
If you can describe it, it exists in a database somewhere.

Databases come in all shapes and sizes, but arguably the most common ones, and definitely the most _traditional_ ones, store data entries in structured tables.
These **S**tructured tables can be **Q**ueried using a specialized **L**anguaged called the Structued Query Language, or `SQL` (typically pronounced like "sequel").

The (mis)use of SQL leads to all sorts of potential security issues, as we'll explore later on this platform.
For now, this module will teach you (or, rather, force you to learn) SQL through a series of challenges that will expose you to the parts of the language that will become relevant later.

Welcome to the SQL playground.
