HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the lingua franca of the open Internet: the common tongue through which web applications, servers, and clients communicate.
This module delves deep into the intricate skills of crafting, decoding, and manipulating HTTP requests and responses.
By the end of this journey, you won't be solely reliant on your web browser to make HTTP requests on your behalf.
You'll master the skills to speak directly with web servers, opening a new world of potential.

You will learn about:
- **Headers**: Metadata fields that carry vital information about the request or response.
- **Paths**: The specific locations or resources you're aiming to access.
- **Arguments**: Data points that can alter or dictate the behavior of your request.
- **Form Data**: Data transferred from web forms.
- **JSON**: A popular data interchange format that's lightweight and human-readable.
- **Cookies**: Small data fragments stored on the user's computer, crucial for session management and tracking.
- **Redirects**: Methods web services use to direct your browser from one location to another.

As you push through these challenges, you won't be hacking blind:
```console
hacker@talking-web-level-1:~$ /challenge/run
* Serving Flask app 'run'
* Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
* Running on http://challenge.localhost:80
Press CTRL+C to quit
```

This output, made available through the challenge, directs you into the core of the web server's activities.
Don't ignore it: the server's responses are often hints, meant to nudge you towards the right path when it is unclear.
