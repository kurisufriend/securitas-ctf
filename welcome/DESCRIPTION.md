This module contains challenges that will teach you to interact with the platform!

You can interact with challenges in three ways:
- You can use the Dojo Workspace, a version of Visual Studio Code running inside the dojo.
- You can use the Dojo Desktop, a full Linux GUI desktop running inside the dojo.
- You can set up your ssh client and ssh in.

We'll run you through the first two in this module, and show off some other features of the platform!

Below, you will see a list of learning resources ("Lectures and Reading") and a set of practice problems ("Challenges").
Each entry in the list is expandable: click/tap on it to expand the content.
You can go ahead and watch the Getting Started video below, or dive straight into the Using the VSCode Workspace challenge!
