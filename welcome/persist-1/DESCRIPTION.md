Your home directory in the dojo is persistent between challenges.
This means that when you start a new challenge, all of the files you have saved in there will still be there.
You can use it to build up notes across multiple challenges in a module, reference old solutions, or rerun solutions perfected in Practice mode against challenges in non-Practice mode.

This challenge, and the next, will drive home the point by having you write a file in your home directory.
Launch this challenge (`/challenge/solve`) and follow its instructions!
