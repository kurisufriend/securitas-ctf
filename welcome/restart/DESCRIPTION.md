Hacking is a contact sport.
There will be times when your attempts to hack through a level will result in irreparable damage to the workspace environment.
When this happens, don't panic, you can just restart the challenge!

This level will guide you through this concept.
On your first attempt, it will ask you for a password that you don't yet know.
When you get this password wrong, it will tell you what the right one is, but will then destroy the challenge and the flag file.
You'll need to restart the challenge (go back to this page and click the Start button below!) to try again.

Just start the terminal to give it a go.
Good luck!
