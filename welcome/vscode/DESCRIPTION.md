This challenge will teach you to use the Visual Studio Code workspace.
You can start this challenge using the Start button below.
Wait for confirmation that it started, and then click on the Workspace tab in the navigation bar (or, if you are quick enough, the Workspace link in the brief popup)!
Once VSCode loads, launch a terminal (press `Control-Shift-Backtick` or click the `â˜°` button in VSCode's left panel, select the Terminal menu, and click New Terminal) and run the challenge!

When we detect that you have launched the terminal in VSCode, we will give you the flag!
As a reminder, this platform uses flags to track your progress.
Flags are cryptographic tokens that are given to you when you solve challenges.
Once you see it, copy-paste it into the submission box below and submit!
Then, once you get the confirmation that the flag was correct, move on to the next challenge!
